**`Digital Tinkerer (Quality Advocate/Maker/Aspiring Programmer)`**

I'm a career QA Engineer with a solid history of testing mobile and web-based applications. During my tenure, I have had the pleasure of ensuring the quality of mobile apps such as, but not limited to, Bleacher Report Live, PGA Tour, and ConEd. I have also worked on web-based applications such as Tekmetric and Classical Conversations. From implementing automation via Cypress, or even low-code options such as Mabl, to working on my own React Native app for a board game I am developing, I am always trying to upskill, learn more, and push my development knowledge to the next level.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Andrews Coding Journey</h3></summary>

<br>I began my coding journey in my early teens by tinkering with DarkBASIC, trying to learn to make my own point-and-click adventure games. I have dabbled with Python in making text adventures, UnityScript, and C# via Unity 3D. All in all, I have always explored and been involved in technology and software in one way or another. Recently, I have really wanted to understand more, and rather than merely hacking things together, I have decided to dedicate time to pursue more robust knowledge and expand my toolbelt. This is not just for quality testing purposes but also to create my own digital products.
